        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a developer who enjoys creating modern, clean, and responsive websites using technologies like
          <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began coding as I wished to realize my thoughts in actual digital experiences.
          At the moment, I am continuously working on my full-stack development skills and hope to become a professional web developer.
